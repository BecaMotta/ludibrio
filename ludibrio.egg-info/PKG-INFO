Description: MOCK
        ====
        
        Mocks are what we are talking about here:
        objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a
        specification of the calls they are expected to receive.
        
        >>> from ludibrio import mock
        
        >>> with mock() as greetings:
        ...     greetings.excuse_me() >> 'Com licença'
        ...     greetings.hello('Gustavo') >> 'Ola, Gustavo'
        ...     greetings.see_you_soon >> 'Até logo'
        ...     greetings.see_you_soon >> 'Até logo, denovo'
        
        >>> print greetings.excuse_me()
        Com licença
        
        >>> print greetings.hello('Gustavo')
        Ola, Gustavo
        
        >>> print greetings.see_you_soon
        Até logo
        
        >>> print greetings.see_you_soon
        Até logo, denovo
        
        
        >>> print greetings.see_you_soon
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AssertionError: Object's mocks are not pre-programmed with expectations:see_you_soon
        
        
        >>> with mock() as greetings:
        ...     greetings.excuse_me() >> 'Com licença'
        ...     greetings.see_you_soon >> 'Até logo'
        
        >>> print greetings.excuse_me()
        Com licença
        
        >>> print greetings.hello('Gustavo')
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AssertionError: Object's mocks are not pre-programmed with expectations:hello
        
        
        Stubs
        =====
        Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test,
        usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test.
        
        >>> from ludibrio import stub
        
        >>> with stub() as greetings:
        ...     greetings.excuse_me() >> 'Com licença'
        ...     greetings.hello('Gustavo') >> 'Ola, Gustavo'
        ...     greetings.see_you_soon = 'Até logo'
        
        
        >>> print greetings.hello('Gustavo')
        Ola, Gustavo
        
        >>> print greetings.excuse_me()
        Com licença
        
        >>> print greetings.hello('Gustavo')
        Ola, Gustavo
        
        >>> print greetings.see_you_soon
        Até logo
        
        
        Dummy
        =====
        Dummy objects are passed around but never validated.
        
        >>> from ludibrio import Dummy
        
        >>> Dummy()
        Dummy object
        
        >>> def teste(x):
        ...     x.write("teste")
        ...     x.close()
        
        >>> teste(Dummy()) #Dummy ~== Foda-se
        
        >>> dummy = Dummy()
        >>> dummy.foo()
        Dummy object
        >>> dummy.bar
        Dummy object
        >>> dummy.one.two.three()
        Dummy object
        
        >>> 1 + Dummy()
        Dummy object
        >>> Dummy() -1
        Dummy object
        >>> Dummy()[4]
        Dummy object
        
        >>> dummy = Dummy()
        >>> dummy ** 22 and dummy / dummy
        Dummy object
        >>> dummy * 69 or dummy // dummy == "Anything"
        Dummy object
        
        >>> for i in Dummy():print i
        Dummy object
        
        >>> list(Dummy())
        [Dummy object]
        >>> Dummy()[2:9]
        Dummy object
